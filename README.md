# Linear Regression on Flight Price Prediction

## Description

This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to handle missing values and redundant variables. Linear Regression was fitted and analyzed to diagnose issues such as Multicollinearity, Heteroscedasticity, and Autocorrelation. The project achieved an adjusted R² value of 0.9109 with Linear Regression and 0.7091 with the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. To further improve performance, Stacking and Blending techniques were applied, resulting in an improved R² value of 0.9235 and a reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from 4487 to 4478.
